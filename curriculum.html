                        <p class="intro-text">Using five major course modules—Self-Development, Subject Knowledge, Cultural Society, Graduation Projects, and Individual Needs—to inspire students' innate potential. Traditional core subjects such as Chinese, English, and Mathematics are no longer mandatory; instead, the focus is on enhancing students' self-awareness, career exploration, and their ability to face and solve problems in society. Additionally, courses addressing individual needs are provided to develop professional fields, cultivating students to become innovative talents with learning ability, influence, mobility, and alignment with the global landscape.</p>

                            <p>In response to adolescents at the initial stage of career and aspiration choices, a psychological growth course focused on self-awareness and potential development is planned. The course theme is "The Hero's Journey Towards Awakening." The content combines sharing discussions and feedback in small groups for self-growth, along with thematic experiential activities for self-awareness and growth work. On this hero's journey of exploring the inner self, participants will come to know and connect with their more authentic selves, enabling them to bravely live out the visions promised in their life blueprint.</p>

                            <h3>Subject Knowledge</h3>
                            <p>Based on students' needs to understand the knowledge system of human civilization, a curriculum is designed that encompasses both foundational and advanced subject knowledge. This is comprehensively planned across three grade levels, providing students with elective learning opportunities based on their own levels and comprehensive recommendations from learning support teachers. In addition to establishing students' basic academic abilities, the curriculum also offers exploration and preparation for subsequent advanced knowledge development and program transitions.</p>

                            <h3>Cultural Society</h3>
                            <p>The curriculum is scheduled over the three years of high school and is part of the school's required subjects, comprising a total of six major themes. The courses are arranged in a progressive manner, in the following order: Design Thinking, Digital Age, Issue Exploration, Digital Citizenship, Civic Action, and Social Innovation.

                                The course design employs interdisciplinary integration and Project-Based Learning (PBL) methods, allowing students to explore learning and solve problems in real-life contexts. The curriculum design and instruction follow the 4E and 6C frameworks from the global educational innovation organization New Pedagogies for Deep Learning (NPDL), cultivating key competencies in students such as Character, Creativity, Communications, Collaboration, Citizenship, and Critical Thinking.
                                
                                This approach aims to enhance students' awareness of issues, innovative thinking methods, analytical skills for issue exploration, information utilization skills, problem-solving action capabilities, and mobility across disciplines and nations. It is hoped that students will demonstrate their citizenship through cultural and social courses, exerting influence on society and the international community.</p>

                            <p>Students will independently complete a meaningful graduation project to demonstrate their learning ability, influence, and mobility. The school's vision for students is to be independent individuals with learning capacity, influence, and mobility, capable of facing the complex and uncertain challenges of the future. Therefore, students must engage in an in-depth graduation project before graduation, showcasing how they apply their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values to create new value, assume social responsibility, and resolve disputes and conflicts. This graduation project will reflect students' ability development throughout their high school careers and promote self-practice or social change.</p>

                            <p>Based on the course demands presented by students, learning resources or relevant courses will be provided, allowing students to select electives across three grade levels. In accordance with the "Implementation Guidelines for Credit Transfer and Grade Calculation for Off-Campus Learning for Senior High School Students in Taipei City," credits will be certified. This empowers students to truly take ownership of their learning! Students can combine course modules to enrich their curriculum map, enabling each student's learning path to be unique.</p>

                        <p>As students progress to higher grades, the hours of asynchronous courses will increase, while the time spent on campus will significantly decrease, which greatly tests students' self-discipline. Most of the in-person courses for first-year high school students will take place at the Hongdao Base (within Hongdao Junior High School), while the courses for second and third-year students will be conducted at the Jilin Base.</p>
